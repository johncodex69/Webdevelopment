<p>
    Python is a programming language used to make repositories of codes.
    It works with various<br> other programming languages to
    create websites and many different programmes.In a span<br>
    of a week and a half,we have learnt to efficiently
    use python to the point of creating websites.<br>
</p>
<p>
    Examples of things learnt in python programming
    are:
</p>
    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>
    We start of the programming journey with simple codes that
    help one to understand the python language<br> and how to use it.
    This involved;finding the area of a rectangle using python,giving
    user feedback,<br>how to use range <b>and</b> working with variables.    
</p>
<p>
    Examples of these are in the link below:<br>

</p>    
    <h3>2. Lists</h3>
    Lists are an important part of programming since
    they are so oftenly used.It is an advancement on
    first lessons<br>since instead of coding one set
    of information(a sring),one can code a huge set
    of information that works<br> together to give
     certain set of information to a user.
</p>
<p>
    We learn to manipulate data in a list to make it fit
    different criterias.This includes asking for user input<br>
    then giving the user feedback depending on their input. 
    The data can be programmed to give different<br>
    data according different scenarios where there are 
    different inputs from the user(s).
</p>
<p>
    There are a number of things that one can do to program
    a list to give vaying feedback on different inputs.These
    are;
    <ul>
        <li>Finding index of the list(Indexing)</li>
        <li>Adding elements to the end of a list(Appending)</li>
        <li>Arranging the list in ascending order(Sorting)</li>
    </ul>
    Just to name a few.<br>
    More examples can be found in the link below:<br>

</p>
    <h3>3. Tables</h3>
<p>
     Python can work with other programming languages e.g.html,
     to allow creation of tables.<br>
     These tables can hold a large number of information
     and can be modified to certain<br> preferences of the
     programmer either to be aesthetically pleasing or easily
     readable.
</p>
<p>
    An example of the tables that can be created can be found
    in the link below:<br>
